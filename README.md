# IMDb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IMDb dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within movie ratings, genres, release years, and other relevant features. Python's data science libraries are used to handle data processing, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

## Project Overview

This analysis seeks to understand various aspects of IMDb movie data, such as popular genres, average ratings over time, and relationships between movie attributes. Visualizations and descriptive statistics are utilized to make the dataset's patterns more interpretable and to help answer key questions about the film industry.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis of movie genres, ratings, release years, and more
- Visualizations to identify trends and distributions
- Insights into IMDb movie ratings and genre preferences

## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Optional libraries:

- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for running `.ipynb` files.
- Additional libraries that may be specific to this notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the notebook `imdb_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run each cell sequentially to execute the EDA and generate visualizations.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is the IMDb dataset, which includes information about movies, such as titles, genres, release years, and ratings. If using a custom dataset, make sure to update the path accordingly.

> **Note:** The dataset should be updated periodically if new data is to be included in the analysis.

## Results

The analysis provides insights on:

- Most common genres and trends over time
- Distribution and trends in IMDb ratings
- Relationships between movie attributes and their IMDb ratings
